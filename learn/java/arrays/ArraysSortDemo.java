         * breaks the array into sub-arrays that are themselves sorted and then merged.
         * 
         * This method uses the ForkJoin pool for executing parallel tasks. The array is
         * sorted parallelly only when certain conditions are met. If the array size is
         * less than or equal to 8192 or the processor has only one core, then the
         * sequential dual-pivot Quicksort algorithm is used. Otherwise, it uses a
         * parallel sort.
